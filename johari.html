            <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            <p>
                There are four quadrants namely<br>
                • Open Area/Arena - Known to you and others<br>
                • Blind Spot - Not known to you but others known<br>
                • Façade - Known to you but not known to others<br>
                • Unknown - Not know to you and others<br>         
                The size of each quadrant helps you to know yourself better.
            </p>
